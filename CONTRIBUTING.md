# Pull Requests

Before submitting a feature or fix PR, please make sure your changes are targeted to one feature or fix, and all your commits are signed off. (Learn more the DCO [here](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco))

If you're making a change to the chart templates or `values.yaml`, please also do the following:

1. Ensure the chart is linted using [`helm lint`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint/)
2. Test rendering the helm templates from the chart root dir (`charts/nextcloud`) using `helm template .`
    - If you're making a change to a non-default value, please also test that value change locally. You can pass in a custom values file to `helm template` with `--values mycustomvalues.yaml`
3. Test installing the chart. A great tool for this is [`ct`](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/tree/main) using [`ct install`](https://github.com/helm/chart-testing/blob/main/doc/ct_install.md) on a test cluster like [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
4. Make sure new or changed values are updated in the [values.yaml](./charts/nextcloud/values.yaml) and the [README.md](./charts/nextcloud/README.md)
5. Run the [helm unittests](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest): `helm unittest charts/nextcloud` and if necessary update the tests in the snapshot files in the `tests` directory or run `helm unittest charts/nextcloud --update-snapshots`. For bigger features a new test should be added.
6. Bump the `version` in the [Chart.yaml](./charts/nextcloud/Chart.yaml) according to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) which uses the format `major.minor.patch`.

Then, please make sure you follow the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md), so we can more quickly review. In order to move your PR forward faster (for instance, bumping the helm chart version for you), please also check the "Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers" box next to the "Create pull request" button:
